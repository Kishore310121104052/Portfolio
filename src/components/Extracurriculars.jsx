                            This photo captures my passion for UI/UX design, where I immerse myself 
                            in creating user-friendly and visually appealing interfaces. Using Figma 
                            as my primary tool, I explore innovative design solutions that enhance user experiences. 
                            My dedication to understanding user needs drives me to craft intuitive designs that 
                            not only look great but also provide seamless interactions.

                            This photo captures my early morning routine of jogging along the serene beachside at 6 AM. 
                            The tranquil waves and soft morning light create the perfect atmosphere for reflection and rejuvenation. 
                            Jogging not only keeps me physically fit but also clears my mind and sets a positive tone for the day ahead.

                            This photo showcases my participation in the 2023 symposium at Anand Institute of Higher Technology, 
                            where I not only engaged in various activities but also took part in a Free Fire gaming competition. 
                            I am proud to have won a cash prize of â‚¹1500, highlighting my skills and strategic thinking in the game. 
                            This experience enriched my college journey, allowing me to connect with peers while enjoying a competitive 
                            and fun environment.
