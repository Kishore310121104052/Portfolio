              During my school years, I pursued my education in Tamil medium, where I developed a strong love for the Tamil language. 
              Though I wasnâ€™t a topper, I was an average student who actively participated in various school activities. 
              I had the opportunity to visit many interesting places, including the Railway Metro Station in 9th std, 
              and the Mudalai Pannai in Pondicherry, which sparked my curiosity about the world around me.
